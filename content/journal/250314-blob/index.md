This animation started as a circle.
The space inside the circle is shaded a darker colour.
The shape of the circle is animated by modulating its size with wave motion.

The first source of wave motion is three times the frequency of the base circle.
That wave moves clockwise around the circle.

The second wave is two times the frequency of the base circle.
It's harder to see, but it moves in the opposite direction, counter-clockwise.

When both waves are added to the base circle they make an interesting kind of motion.

The animation is deliberately rendered at a low resolution because I like the way the jagged edges look as they move.
