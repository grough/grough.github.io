This animation started as a circle.
The space inside the circle is shaded a darker colour.
The shape of the circle is animated by adding some wavy motion to its perimeter.

The first wave is three times the frequency of the base circle.
That one move clockwise.

The second wave is two times the frequency of the base circle.
It's harder to see, but it moves in the opposite direction, counter-clockwise.

When both waves are added to the base circle they make kind of an interesting motion.
