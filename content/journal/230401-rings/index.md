This is the result of a digital painting process using several different alpha masks overlayed on top of each other. Each mask layer is build from repeating gradients that radiate out from the centre.

Each mask layer has twice the number of concentric circles as the previous one.

I imported each layer into a digital painting app and painted using layers as separate alpha masks.
